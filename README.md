UPPER EXTREMITY JOINT ANGLES AND GROUND REACTION FORCE IN RELATION TO 
PITCHING VELOCITY

 
Introduction:

	One of the most important aspects of pitching, especially at the major league level, is velocity. In the MLB in 2023, the average 4-seam fastball velocity was 94-mph which emphasizes the importance of velocity if an individual aspires to pitch at the highest level [2]. The higher the velocity, the less time a batter has to react to the pitch characteristics and location, which in turn makes it harder to hit. The reaction time for a batter on a 90-mph fastball is .458 seconds and the reaction time for a batter on a 95-mph fastball is .434 seconds [mlb static]. The difference of .024 seconds might not seem like much, however considering it is roughly 5.5 perfcent of total reaction time at 95-mph, that can be the difference in a batter being able to check their swing on a bad pitch, or even the difference between putting the ball in play or missing the ball entirely. 
In order to achieve maximal velocity, every component of the body needs to work in a coordinated fashion as efficiently as possible. To evaluate a pitcher’s throwing mechanics, marker, or marker less motion capture is used in coordination with force plates to get a total picture of a pitcher throughout their throwing motion. The purpose of this study was to examine upper body joint angles as well as push-off leg and plant leg ground reaction forces and assess their relation to pitching velocity. 

Methods:

	100 baseball pitchers from varying playing levels (college, independent, MiLB, and high school) threw a combined 411 fastballs. Kinematic data from 29 upper body markers were collected with a motion capture system at 1,080Hz, kinetic data were collected from 3 force plates placed under an artificial pitching mound at 360 Hz, with one under the pitching rubber, and two placed under the landing area of the mound. All kinematic data were filtered with a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20.0 Hz and ground reaction force data were filtered with a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40.0 Hz [3].
Data from the upper body markers and ground reaction forces were input into linear regression models with fastball velocity as the target variable. The kinematic data were sorted in descending order by fastball velocity with subsets being created for the top 20 percent and bottom 20 percent. Distribution of fastball velocity between the two groups can be seen in figure 1. Statistically significant variables identified with linear regression were then compared between the top 20 percent and bottom 20 percent.

Results and Discussion:

	Four of the six joint angle measurements had statistically significant differences between the top 20 percent and bottom 20 percent fastball velocity groups. There were also statistically significant differences in lead GRF and rear GRF values between the two groups (Table 1). 
	
	These differences indicate that there are degrees of elbow flexion, elbow pronation, glove shoulder horizontal adduction, and glove shoulder external rotation, that facilitate greater fastball velocity generation. It also highlights the importance of force generation with the rear push-off leg as well as on the lead plant leg. Interestingly, while the glove shoulder angles have significant variance among the two groups, the dominant or throwing shoulder appears to be relatively similar between the two groups. This would highlight the importance of a pitcher controlling their glove arm when pitching and is in line with studies done on the subject. What studies have shown is that an uncontrolled glove arm can cause trunk rotation to occur to early in the pitch delivery and lose rotational power needed for maximum arm speed. On top of the loss of power, this over-rotated position can put a pitcher at increased risk for injury [1].   

Significance:

	Ideal joint angles can be used by pitching coaches in an attempt to help pitchers increase their fastball velocity. Along with increasing fastball velocity, proper mechanics can ensure the increase in velocity is not at the detriment of shoulder or elbow health by compensating for poor mechanics.
